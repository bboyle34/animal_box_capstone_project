# animal_box_capstone_project
CIS and SMAD collaboration for our capstone project Spring 2020

# THE PLAN
A version of our project will be hosted on the elastic beanstalk instance at all times. 

This will be a functioning version so if our client or Cole asks for a quick demo, we can pull it up and not worry about deploying.

While that version is on the server, all of our changes will be made to the github version.

Pull the current version down to Visual Studio, make the changes, and push that back up.
  
  you will need the github extension for visual studio

Once a week - or so - we will deploy a working version of newly updated code to the server.
  
  you will need the aws extension for visual studio
